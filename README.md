# Exploring the Goldmine that is Data: The Fundamentals of Text Mining

# An introduction to text mining:
Text Mining is used to answer specific research questions. Say you want to answer – “Why cats sit on mats?” It would be a daunting task to read all the millions of research articles on the topic.
 
Let us take a look at this example (with the added visual of a cat sitting on a mat) to understand where text mining can help.
It filters large amounts of research and extracts the relevant information you seek. For example, in this sentence the program would identify “cat” as the noun, “sit” as the verb and “on” as the preposition. However, it is not just a search tool. It can also understand that “cat” is an animal, “sit” is an action and the “mat” is an object. It then identifies and maps patterns and trends across the millions of articles. For example, it can even tell us if most of the cats that sit on mats are native to places will typically cold weather. This detailed, relevant information helps us determine what additional research is needed in order to answer our questions. So one can now get a head start for further research to find out the exact reasons. 

Although this might sound straight forward and simple, text mining requires a lot of different tools and resources to make this work. The five fundamental steps involved in text mining are:
1)	Collecting unstructured data from various data sources. This could be plain text, web pages, pdf files, blogs, emails and so on
2)	Identifying and removing anomalies from the data by conducting pre-processing and data cleaning operations. Cleaning up the data enables one to extract and retain the valuable information hidden within the data and to help identify the roots of specific words
3)	Converting all the relevant information extracted from unstructured data into structured formats
4)	Analyze the patterns within the data
5)	Store all the valuable information into a secure database to drive trend analysis
 
# How does text mining work?
Researchers can solve specific research questions by using text mining. 
The first step in text mining is to collect the content that must be mined, like white papers and academic articles. Then one proceeds by applying a text mining tool which helps extract the information one seeks from large amounts of content. The tool extracts by learning how to find information within each article. It examines complex research content containing unique language, abbreviations, codes, and symbols. Researchers are left with a long list of extracted words and sentences. The text mining tool also understands how the words relate to one another and can analyze the results. It enables researchers to see emerging trends and patterns. This would be impossible to do if the researchers had to manually read all the content. This results in new insights which helps answer their research questions. 

# What’s NLP got to do with Text mining?
While Text Mining or Text analytics is the process of deriving meaningful information from natural language text. It usually involves structuring the input text, deriving patterns within the structured data and finally evaluating and interpreting the output.
On the other hand, Natural Language Processing refers to the artificial intelligence method of communicating with an intelligent system using the natural language. So while text mining is all about deriving high quality information from the text, NLP enables one to turn this extracted text into data analysis. That is why Text mining and NLP go hand in hand.

# A little bit about NLP:
Word Embedding is one of the techniques of word representation in NLP that allows words with similar meaning to be understood by machine learning algorithms. Technically speaking, it is a mapping of words into vectors of real numbers using the neural network, probabilistic model, or dimension reduction on word co-occurrence matrix.
A document-term matrix is a mathematical matrix in NLP that describes the frequency of terms that occur in a collection of documents. In a document-term matrix, rows correspond to documents in the collection and columns correspond to terms.
Better representation of word relationships is the reason why word embeddings are a better representation of text with respect to NLP compared to document term matrix.

Word embedding allows us to hope that, in the vector space where the embedding is made, we will have the equations
•	King – man + woman = Queen
•	London – England + Italy = Rome
We will be able to find out that the word “pet” is closer to the word “dog” than it is to “lighthouse”.

In the case of Document term matrix, it describes the frequency of terms that occur in sentences. Relationships between words is not as straightforward.  Mitigating the curse of dimensionality is what allows word embedding models give better results for any NLP exercise when compared to Document Term Matrix. Without word embedding, the unique identifiers representing the words generate scattered data, isolated points in a vast sparse representation. With word embedding, the space becomes much more limited in terms of dimensionality with a widely richer amount of semantic information. 


# Applications of Text Mining
1)	Identify and recommend relevant research documents 
2)	Customer Care Service
3)	Social Media Analysis

# Conclusion:
The global Text Mining Market is booming every passing day and is will reportedly be valued at USD 16.85 billion by 2027.  With more and more processes moving online world over, across industries, growing use of cloud storage and the increasing social media traffic, the amount of text generated is exponentially increasing. When mined, the text provides valuable insights into trends, topics of discussion, public perception, and more. NLP is still challenging, and it is still difficult to accurately learn and mimic language using AI, but the more we leverage these technologies, the more we can build on them and make them better.
